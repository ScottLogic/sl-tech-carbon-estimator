# Best Practice Guide for Estimation Inputs

Use this guide to assist you when entering your Estimate Inputs

## Data Collection

- Review the different input sections and gather all relevant data before starting.
- Use official sources and documentation where possible.
- Double-check values for accuracy.

## Organisation

#### Whole organisation or department:

- Enter the total number of employees
- Select the percentage of device usage as accurately as possible
- Select the location where the MAJORITY of employees are located

#### Specific service/project within the organisation:

- Enter the number of users actively engaged in this service/project who are using any devices
- Select the percentage of device usage as accurately as possible
- Select the location where the MAJORITY of these users are located


## On-Premise Servers

On-Premise servers include any physical servers either located directly in-house or managed by your organisation in a remote location. 


## Cloud Services

Data regarding the number of on-premise and cloud provider servers should be available from your IT/Technology team.

All major cloud providers provide tooling that allows billing data to be obtained. Your IT/Technology team should also be able to tell you where the majority of your cloud provider servers are located.


## Customers

Determining the primary purpose of your digital service can often be challenging. The TSCE provides 4 specific categories for you to choose from, each one with increasing emission impacts:

- Information
- E-Commerce
- Social Media
- Streaming 

Information is a very broad category but can cover everything up to and including capturing data from users (forms, user account creation) and simple checkout/payment services (paying a bill or invoice).

E-Commerce sites tend to be more involved, with users spending much more time navigating/browsing the site and more involved checkout/payment processes.

Social Media services will usually involve much more content, images and short videos, along with fairly extended user engagement times.

Streaming services (audio and video) are generally thought of as providing longer form digital content of a high quality (lossless audio, 4k video).#
