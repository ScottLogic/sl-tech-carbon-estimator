  <h2 class="tce-text-2xl">Assumptions and Limitations</h2>
  <p class="tce-text-sm">
    The Technology Carbon Estimator tool is designed to give a high-level overview of the possible areas of carbon
    impact within your IT estate. We use a minimal number of questions to present this view, so we must make some
    assumptions based on that, which we list here for clarity. Where there are aspects that cannot be covered by this
    methodology, we also call out its limitations.
  </p>

  <h3 class="tce-text-xl">Assumptions</h3>

  <h4 class="tce-text-lg">Time period</h4>
  <p class="tce-text-sm">
    The estimation is based on a typical year's utilization. Where relevant for energy calculations, we use different
    typical numbers of hours for different classes of hardware:
  </p>
  <ul class="tce-list-disc tce-list-inside">
    <li class="tce-text-sm">
      Desktops, Laptops and Monitors - These both assume 8 hours of daily usage, for 230 days a year.
    </li>
    <li class="tce-text-sm">
      Servers and Networking Devices - These both assume 24 hours of daily usage, for 365 days a year.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="tce-text-sm">
    Obviously, this may not match up with your organisation's usage, either due to different working hours or whether
    equipment is turned off during out of work hours.
  </p>
  <h4 class="tce-text-lg">Number of Employee Devices</h4>
  <p class="tce-text-sm">
    Without a specified number of devices, we estimate based on the number of employees and the proportion of desktops
    to laptops specified. We also assume that all employees are provided with a single monitor. This may be an
    overestimate if a significant number of employees are not provided with devices, or an underestimate if they
    typically have more than one.
  </p>
  <h4 class="tce-text-lg">Number of Servers</h4>
  <p class="tce-text-sm">
    Without a specified number of servers, we give an initial estimate based on the 10% of the number of employees. This
    is reduced based on the percentage of cloud services that you report you make use of.
  </p>
  <h4 class="tce-text-lg">Number of Networking Devices</h4>
  <p class="tce-text-sm">
    At present, we estimate a number of large networking devices based on the combined number of desktop devices and
    servers, applying a 50% ratio.
  </p>
  <h4 class="tce-text-lg">Power consumption</h4>
  <p class="tce-text-sm">
    Each class of device is given an average power demand, based on data compiled from multiple sources and our own
    research. The figures are rounded to the nearest Watt:

    We have derived average figures to convert from US dollars spent, to kWh of energy and kg of embodied CO2e.
    Beginning with a list of AWS EC2 instance prices, we combined this with
    <a

      href="https://github.com/cloud-carbon-footprint/cloud-carbon-coefficients/blob/main/data/aws-instances.csv">

    >
    data from Cloud Carbon Footprint's coefficients.<br />
    We calculated kWh per $ and kg CO2e per $ figures for each entry in the price list. For kWh we used the Wattage
    reported under 50% load, the same default utilisation used by the Cloud Carbon Footprint tool. For kg CO2e we assume
    a 4 year lifespan and a proportion of the embodied carbon relative the the amount of vCPUs allocated to the
    instance.<br />
    Some of the results from this were as follows:

    Clearly there is a large amount of variation here, with a wide variety of pricing options available based on lease
    period and upfront payment etc. This also only covers a single service that AWS provides but could be seen as the
    simplest available, with the most direct link between pricing and kWh of power available. Other services may cost
    more based on the additional management that AWS performs, which does not necessarily translate into an increase in
    power used. For these reasons we have decided to use the mean figures of ~0.156 kWh/$ and ~0.0164 kg CO2e/$ as the
    method of transforming cloud costs to kWh and kg CO2e for the purposes of Cloud Emissions.

  <p class="tce-text-sm">
    The estimated kWh of cloud usage is combined with an average Cloud PUE figure of {{ CLOUD_AVERAGE_PUE }} and the

  <h4 class="tce-text-lg">Downstream Emissions</h4>
  <p class="tce-text-sm">
    At present we focus on the downstream impact of web based services, estimating an amount time spent in hours and of
    Data transferred in Gb per month. To do this we have collated some average usage figures for different kinds of web
    services from online sources and our own research:

    These figures are combined with the provided Monthly active user number and service type to estimate figures for a
    full year. It should be noted that the 'Unspecified' option uses an average of the above figures and is not an
    attempt to describe an average website. For a general purpose static website the most appropriate option is
    'Information'.
  </p>
  <h4 class="tce-text-lg">Network Data Transfer</h4>
  <p class="tce-text-sm">
    Our outgoing network data estimation makes use of the
    <a href="https://developers.thegreenwebfoundation.org/co2js/overview/">CO2.js</a> library, specifically using the
    <a href="https://sustainablewebdesign.org/calculating-digital-emissions/">Sustainable Web Design</a> model. This
    methodology is often used to give an overview of the carbon emissions of an entire website but it can also focus on
    single components like Network infrastructure. We felt that this was the most appropriate method to use at this
    point in time, due to the difficulties involved in making a more specific estimation of the Downstream Network
    infrastructure used by an organisation.
  </p>
  <h4 class="tce-text-lg">End-User Devices</h4>
  <p class="tce-text-sm">
    We combine device information to give an average power demand for a typical user of web services. Mobile phones are
    called out specifically as a separate percentage, due to their relatively low power demand. This is also an aspect
    that we want to break down further as there can be significant differences based on the method of data transfer
    (Wifi vs 3/4/5G).
  </p>
  <h3 class="tce-text-xl">Limitations</h3>
  <p class="tce-text-sm">
    Here are some aspects of the Tech Carbon Standard, which the tool currently does not consider.
  </p>
  <h4 class="tce-text-lg">Upstream Emissions</h4>
  <h5 class="tce-text-base">Off the Shelf Software</h5>
  <p class="tce-text-sm">
    This is a tough area to estimate even with a detailed breakdown of the commercial software that an organisation
    makes use of. It is uncommon for organisations to publish the carbon footprint information for a piece of software.
    Even if this was available, there is still a question of how to apportion a given total to an organisation making
    use of it.
  </p>
  <p class="tce-text-sm">
    Without this kind of detailed information, we could only make limited guesses about the typical software that might
    be used by an organisation of a given size within a specific industry. At this point in time, we do not feel that we
    have enough information to make an educated guess at its impact, although we welcome any contributions towards
    taking this into account.
  </p>
  <h4 class="tce-text-lg">Operational Emissions - Direct</h4>
  <h5 class="tce-text-base">Generators</h5>
  <p class="tce-text-sm">
    In the interests of using information that should be easy to source, we have omitted questions about whether your
    data centers have fossil fuel based generators and how often they are used. This is something we could investigate
    further in future, either via new questions or by using more fine-grained location data to estimate an average
    amount of electricity network downtime that might be typical and what effect that might have on your average Carbon
    Intensity.
  </p>
  <h4 class="tce-text-lg">Operational Emissions - Indirect</h4>
  <h5 class="tce-text-base">SaaS</h5>
  <p class="tce-text-sm">
    Like Off the shelf and open source software, this can be a difficult area to estimate even with the knowledge of the
    software services in use. This aspect is excluded at this point in time but we hope to consider more in future. Some
    aspects can be similar to Cloud Services that follow best practices.
  </p>
  <h5 class="tce-text-base">Managed Services</h5>
  <p class="tce-text-sm">
    We currently do not make a distinction between on-premises data centers and those ran by a third party.
